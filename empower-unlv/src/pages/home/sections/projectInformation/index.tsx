        This project is a collaboration between the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD), Southern
        Nevada Water Authority (SNWA), Desert Research Institute (DRI), and the University of
        Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).

        Genetic material from the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 can be present in human
        waste even when individuals have no symptoms. Tracking the amount of viral genetic material
        (viral load) in wastewater is an emerging method of monitoring increasing and decreasing
        trends of the virus in communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wastewater monitoring can provide early awareness of potential outbreaks. This is because
        people who have been infected can take several days before showing symptoms. As a result,
        the information can help direct testing and resources during a surge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wastewater monitoring cannot directly tell us the number of individuals currently infected
        with COVID-19. However, as data are collected and trends are identified, that information
        may be helpful to track the progression of the virus in communities and inform public health
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This data should not be used as the sole method of measuring COVID-19 prevalence. This is an
        innovative method that may be used in addition to other data sources for the detection of
        new and re-emerging outbreaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are testing COVID-19 viral load in the wastewater of participating community water
        systems across Southern Nevada. This is new science for COVID-19 tracking. Nevada is one of
        the first states to initiate this testing and this is one of the largest scale projects in
        the U.S.
